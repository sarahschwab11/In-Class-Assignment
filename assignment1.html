<h1>First Day of School</h1>

	<p>Anita went to bed dreaming of the adventures that would take place the next morning. It would be her first day of school. Anita woke up early in the morning and get ready for the school. She hurried to the breakfast table where her breakfast was ready. <em>She ate happily.</em> She was very excited for the classroom activities. <br>Anita and her mom and dad rushed to the stand where other kids were waiting for the bus. Kids talked about the fun they were going to experience at school. The bus stopped at the corner. All the kids climbed into the bus. Anita waved goodbye to her mom and dad as she moved towards the bus. Anita’s mom and dad also waved her goodbye as she started for her school. <b>They were excited too for the first day of the school.</b><br><p> <hr>


<h2>Lunch Time</h2>

<p><b>Now it’s time for lunch.</b> All the students gathered in the school cafeteria. Everybody chose his favorite lunch. They were free to talk. Anita picked up her favorite lunch and ate heartily. After the lunch time was over children were free to go to the playground and have fun and play games. Anita and a few students played a game of football. Everyone said that Anita played <em>very well.</em> <br>After the game was over the teacher told students to draw and paint a beautiful art pieces. Students were given paper and colors. The teacher exhibited all the pictures on the wall. Anita painted a fruit tray. It was the time to go to the library. All the students went there and picked up the picture story books. They tried to understand the story by watching the pictures. Anita also picked up a nice story book.<br><p> <hr>
